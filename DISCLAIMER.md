# DISCLAIMER

This project is an independent, community-driven effort to modernize and make cross‑platform an implementation
inspired by the open‑sourced SAGE engine. It is not affiliated with, sponsored by, endorsed by, or otherwise
connected to Electronic Arts (EA), Westwood Studios, or any of their parent companies, subsidiaries, or
licensors. All trademarks, logos, and game titles referenced are the property of their respective owners.

The SAGE engine is cited here as inspiration and reference only. The primary objective of this project is to
create a modern, cross‑platform engine and tooling. This project is explicitly not intended to maintain
compatibility with the original commercial games — including online or multiplayer compatibility — and will
not guarantee game‑level behavior parity.

To achieve modernization and improved cross‑platform support the project may remove legacy engine features that
are not required for the intended targets and may introduce new features, refactors, and bug fixes as necessary.
Contributors do not claim ownership of any proprietary game code, media, or assets belonging to EA, Westwood,
or other third parties; no proprietary assets are included in this repository unless clearly documented and
properly licensed.

This disclaimer is provided for informational purposes and is not legal advice. For questions about trademarks,
licensing, or legal exposure, please consult qualified legal counsel.
